# Sudoku Solver

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a $9 \times 9$ grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine $3 \times 3$ subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from $1$ to $9$. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
